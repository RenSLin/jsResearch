= JavaScript DataType

* Dynamic & weak typing
** dynamic type where variable type is dynamically defined
+
[,javaScript]
----
let foo = 42; // foo is now a number
foo = "bar"; // foo is now a string
foo = true; // foo is now a boolean

----
** Weak typing which will allow implicit conversions. (More later)


== 原始型別/物件型別 (Primitive vs Object)

* six primitive data types
** null, undefined, boolean, number, Bigint, String, Symbol.
** null is especially troublesome, which typeOf will return an object rather than a type.
* Object data type
** data property
*** value, writable
** accessor property
*** get & set
*  enumerable, configurable

== 顯性轉換/隱性轉換 (Explicit coercion vs Implicit Coercion)

* In JS we can see it as collection of properties
** Explicit Coercion
*** ParseInt, ToString, etc.
** Implicit Coercion
*** hidden one that JS is doing in the background

== 型別比較
* Strict and loose equality (== vs ===)
